This repository contains official inference code for ROME.

This code helps you to create personal avatar from just a single image. 
The resulted meshes can be animated and rendered with photorealistic quality.   


### Important disclaimer
To render ROME avatar with pretrained weights you need download [FLAME model](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php) and [DECA](https://github.com/YadiraF/DECA) weights. 
DECA reconstructs a 3D head model with detailed facial geometry from a single input image for FLAME template.
Also, it can be replaced by another parametric model.

##  Getting started
Initialise submodules and download [DECA](https://github.com/YadiraF/DECA) & [MODNet](https://github.com/ZHKKKe/MODNet) weights

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install requirements and download ROME model: [gDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rLtc037Ra6Z6t0kp-gJ8P1ZKfzkKm070/view?usp=sharing), [y-disk](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/zfGijJPCbgNHUQ). 

Put model into ```data``` folder.

To verify the code with images run: 

```python
python3 infer.py --deca DECA --rome data
```

For linear basis download ROME model: [gDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Enw9MU9Xin77ws08y4pNqkMW0AyUIzv_/view?usp=share_link) (or camera model for voxceleb [gDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PXU96qfiCzaLxTS1TZKgoJZcwJ0n-mh6/view?usp=sharing)), [yDrive](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/u2hRXJGewJoCwQ)

```python
python3 infer.py --deca DECA --rome data  --use_distill True
```
